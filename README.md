# First Year University CRUD project

A web development project - featuring a user-friendly interface. The following technologies were used in the development of this project:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (+JQuery)
- PHP
- SQL

This project allows a user to easily create, read, update and delete (CRUD) records related to music (artists, albums and tracks).
- An artist can have many albums (1 to many relationship)
- An album can have many tracks (1 to many relationship)

There are three tabs - each correlating to an entity of the database. Upon clicking on a tab, the user is presented with a view of the records within the database table plus related data, along with delete/edit/create options.
