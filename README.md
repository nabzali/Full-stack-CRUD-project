# CRUD project

User-friendly web development project. Involved are the following front-end and back-end technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (+JQuery)
- PHP
- SQL

This project allows a user to easily create, read, update and delete data from a database (CRUD).

How it works
--
[XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) is a software package which gives you the priveledge of connecting to an Apache server. Using Apache, along with MySQL, you can create and manipulate databases which can be created using the phyMyAdmin software tool provided. 

As a back-end language, PHP can execute on an external server. I have used PHP to retrieve data from my designated apache server port, which can be fed back to my local machine and rendered/executed in my browser. Equally, I've used it to send data from my browser to the server in order to update my databases if necessary. This capability has led me to develop this project, of course using many web technologies in addition to PHP.

For this to work the directory for all of the files is (crucially) located inside the htdocs folder which can be found in your xampp directory, once you have xampp installed.

Warning
--
Simply downloading this project won't work, even you download it in ~xampp/htdocs. This is because I satisfy the prerequisite of having the appropriately named database and tables that match exactly with the context of these files. However, for inspection purposes, anyone is welcome to view my code.
