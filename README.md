# Front End CRUD Interface

Front end user-friednly database interface project. Involved are the following:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (+JQuery)
- PHP
- SQL

This project allows a user to easily create, read, update and delete data from a database (CRUD).

How it's run
--
This interface uses PHP, which as you may know, is used for connecting to an outside server. Using [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) I have connected to an Apache server - which stores a database that I have created using the phpMyAdmin software tool, which uses MySQL. I have used PHP to connect to this database, retrieve some data, and feed it into the local HTML markup which is executed in my local browser. For this to work the directory for all of the files is (crucially) located inside the htdocs folder which can be found in the xampp directory, if you have xampp installed.

Forking and Cloning
--
Easy copy & paste for cloning:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/nabzali/front-end-crud-interface.git
```
